        <p>Hi there! My name is Keertana Srinivasan and I wrote the content for this website, while the template, <strong>Prologue</strong>, was designed by <a href="http://html5up.net">HTML5 UP</a>. I'm currently a rising senior at Virginia Tech. I'm double majoring in business information technology and creative writing and minoring in entrepreneurship. </p></div>

        <p>I have a fair amount of experience in digital writing, mainly by using it in my daily life. By this, I mean that I have experience writing blog posts on Tumblr, condensing my thoughts into 140 character tweets on Twitter, writing status updates on Facebook, updating my LinkedIn profile, and e-mailing in a professional and personal manner. In addition to this, I have also written for a few professional blogs in the past. I have also used various websites to publish my poetry, essays, and short stories on the web. During my summer internship last year, I also gained some experience in digital writing. I created several powerpoints to explain the projects that my team was working on, to other colleagues. I also used Microsoft Sharepoint during my internship to post summaries and other critical information regarding the health policies my team was working with. These are just some examples of the digital writing experience I have. I've learned a lot more through this class than I expected, and I'm so excited to continue the journey!  </p></div>

It means that a student has a strong understanding and strength in a certain discipline. Since we pursue specific majors in college, the "T" usually refers to how we understand the knowledge we gain through our major. I certainly have worked hard in the classes related to my majors - BIT and Creative Writing. I have a solid understanding of finding IT solutions for business problems and how supply chains and operations function. I have excelled in my classes, gone to office hours to gain additional knowledge, and done research on my own time to learn coding languages and more about IT in general. I also have strong knowledge of creative writing. I have taken classes ranging from fiction to poetry to critical reading to playwriting, and I have tried my hardest in these classes. I attend lectures given by speakers whenever I am available, to gain even more knowledge in these fields. I have compiled many portfolios of my poetry, short stories, essays, and play scripts, and I continue to refer to the feedback I received on these portfolios when I write in my classes today.
                                    
                            <div align="left"><h4><b><u>The Horizontal Component of the T-shaped student: </u></b></h4></div>The T-component's horizontal aspect focuses on our interdisciplinary skills. I have complemented these skills by expanding my knowledge as well - I have done so by taking classes in project management, humanities, ecology and other sciences, technical writing, reading up on information technology during my own time, and more as a way to expand my knowledge even further and be able to look at certain topics through a different lens.

I believe that it's extremely important to always be the best person we can be, and I appreciate that the idea of the VT-shaped student encourages and challenges that belief. While I am proud of my achievements thus far, I believe I still have a ways to go, which is why my claim was that I am in the process of becoming a VT-shaped Student. My plans for the future are to involve myself more in the Virginia Tech community's resources. I'll be more specific.
